# Clock Time

This is a killer app the will change color as time passes. If you ever wanted to know the time without reading half a dozen numbers, you can just look at the color and extrapolate the time from the rgb value of the color.

## How it works

It sets the background color to the rgb value of the current time. Hours = Red, Minutes = Green, Seconds = Blue. The equation with hours, for example, is currentHour / 24 * 255. This way you hit all the colors over the course of a day.

## How to use

Look at the color -> know the time.

## Customization

It's a derivation of time. You can change the background color by changing time, or you can just wait.

## Conclusion

Conclusion is that I can see right now that  it's time to go to bed.

But I also can't sleep because I'm too excited for new years eve when I can watch the color change.
